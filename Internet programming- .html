            [To my best friend Michelle Wairimu. I admire your hard work and perseverance while also having others in mind you are a wonderful friend indeed, you showed a lot of care and compassion when you met me at my lowest and helped me up and I was able to be a better version of myself. Michelle words alone cannot describe you but you are a gem to me, you have accomplished a great sum from being academically gifted while also participating in sports and helping in charity events that have been planned. Acquiring your bachelor's at such a young age and continuing with your masters you are truly a good best friend, you have impacted my life a great deal you made me come out of my shell and try doing things with a positive mind set. I celebrate you for the tutoring that helped me pass most of my exams I appreciate you.]

            [I remember when you brought me snacks and we would share them while chilling when I was down, even at times when I was sick you came over to keep me company, I admired a lot the time I asked you to go with me to tour the city and you would laugh every time I made us get lost and I would try brush it off by just saying 'I meant to do that' only for you to direct me, I felt dumb but happy at the same time because you got me.]
